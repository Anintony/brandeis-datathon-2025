## The Challenge

The challenge was to use the ESPN Soccer Data for Europe’s top five leagues to (1) identify offensive and defensive attributes of top vs. bottom teams, (2) analyze which players contribute most to team success, and (3) predict the likely league winners for each competition.

## Our Solution

We aggregated season-level team and player statistics (goals, shots, clean sheets, cards, etc.) from the ESPN dataset and engineered per-game performance metrics. Using exploratory analysis and a Random Forest–based model, we contrasted top vs. bottom teams, highlighted key contributing players, and produced data-driven predictions for league champions.

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier, model evaluation)  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## How to Replicate

- **Code:** The full analysis is available in the Jupyter Notebook in the `/code/` folder.
- **Data:** The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle as **“ESPN Soccer Data”**.
